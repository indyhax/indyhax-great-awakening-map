<div class='panel'><h3 id='galactic-federation'>Galactic Federation</h3><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Galactic Federation</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> One of the most prominent ET governance phrases. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Supplies supra-national authority figure for intervention, ethics, and conflict mediation. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Adjacent to alliance councils, treaties, and disclosure emissary motifs. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='et-factions.html'>Et</a> / <a href='geopolitics.html'>Geopolitics</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div>
