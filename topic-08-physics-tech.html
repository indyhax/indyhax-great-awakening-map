<div class='panel'><h2>Topic framing</h2><p>This section groups terms under 'Physics-Adjacent / Advanced Tech Claims' while preserving the same paragraph content that existed in A-Z pages.</p></div>
<div class='panel'><h2>Portal Technology</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Portal Technology</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> In advanced-tech and dimensional transit nodes. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Serves as enabling mechanism for fast movement and covert logistics. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Adjacent to multidimensional travel, SSP operations, and ancient gate myths. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='secret-programs.html'>Secret</a> / <a href='cosmology.html'>Cosmology</a> / <a href='et-factions.html'>Et</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Portal Technology (Phrase Family)</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Portal Technology (Phrase Family)</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> In advanced-tech and dimensional transit phrase-family nodes. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Serves as enabling mechanism for fast movement and covert logistics. It is treated as a lexical family with multiple map-adjacent phrasings.

At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Acts as versatile explanatory substrate for healing, propulsion, and interference claims. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Adjacent to frequency activation, portal technology, and energy weapons. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='secret-programs.html'>Secret</a> / <a href='solar-flash.html'>Solar</a> / <a href='health-frequency.html'>Health</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Scalar Energy (Phrase Family)</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Scalar Energy (Phrase Family)</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> In fringe-physics and hidden-tech phrase-family nodes.
