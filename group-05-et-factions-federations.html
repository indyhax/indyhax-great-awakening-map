At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Acts as a neighborhood marker that helps readers orient within a crowded branch. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Sits beside complementary mechanism and actor terms in the same local arc. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='secret-programs.html'>Secret</a> / <a href='et-factions.html'>Et</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div>
