At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Serves as connective vocabulary that lets neighboring claims read as one coherent campaign rather than isolated slogans. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Typically appears adjacent to at least two higher-level anchors and one mechanism term, creating directional narrative flow. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='secret-programs.html'>Secret</a> / <a href='et-factions.html'>Et</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h3 id='xenoanthropology'>Xenoanthropology</h3><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Xenoanthropology</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Visible as part of a nearby phrase family in the map&#x27;s dense callout texture, where short labels stack around a central branch.
