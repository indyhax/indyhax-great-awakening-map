<div class='panel'><h2>Black Budget</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Black Budget</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Central to secret-program finance pathways. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Explains scale by asserting off-ledger funding continuity. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Connected to military-industrial covert nodes, compartmentalization, and underground infrastructure. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='secret-programs.html'>Secret</a> / <a href='geopolitics.html'>Geopolitics</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Black Budget (Phrase Family)</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Black Budget (Phrase Family)</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Central to secret-program finance pathways.
