<div class='panel'><h2>Astral Projection</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Astral Projection</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Embedded in the multidimensional travel cluster with bardo and subtle body terms. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Expands the map from physical geopolitics into experiential metaphysics. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Links to lucid states, rainbow body, and practical meditation. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='cosmology.html'>Cosmology</a> / <a href='health-frequency.html'>Health</a> / <a href='worldview.html'>Worldview</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Astral Projection (Phrase Family)</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Astral Projection (Phrase Family)</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Embedded in the multidimensional travel cluster with bardo and subtle body terms. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Expands the map from physical geopolitics into experiential metaphysics. It is treated as a lexical family with multiple map-adjacent phrasings. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Links to lucid states, rainbow body, and practical meditation.
