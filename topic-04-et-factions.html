<div class='panel'><h2>Topic framing</h2><p>This section groups terms under 'ET / NHI Factions and Alliances' while preserving the same paragraph content that existed in A-Z pages.</p></div>
<div class='panel'><h2>Alliance Councils</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Alliance Councils</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Visible as part of a nearby phrase family in the map&#x27;s dense callout texture, where short labels stack around a central branch. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Serves as connective vocabulary that lets neighboring claims read as one coherent campaign rather than isolated slogans. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Typically appears adjacent to at least two higher-level anchors and one mechanism term, creating directional narrative flow. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='cosmology.html'>Cosmology</a> / <a href='health-frequency.html'>Health</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Alliance Councils Cluster</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Alliance Councils Cluster</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> A clustered variant label implied by repeated nearby wording and arrow groupings.

In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Sits beside complementary mechanism and actor terms in the same local arc. When read with nearby labels, the term behaves like a routing hub that inherits tone from neighboring words and then passes that tone onward to the next branch, creating continuity across the full map. <b>Thematic crosslinks:</b> <a href='cosmology.html'>Cosmology</a> / <a href='health-frequency.html'>Health</a> / <a href='timeline-disclosure.html'>Timeline</a>.</p></div><div class='panel'><h2>Blue Avians</h2><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Blue Avians</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> Core actor in alliance-versus-infiltration ET sections.
