<div class='panel'><h2>How to use this page</h2><p>Each term includes: (1) what the phrase says, (2) local context on the map, (3) narrative role in the full system, and (4) adjacency links (which neighboring clusters it reinforces). This is intentionally exhaustive and repetitive to maximize interpretive clarity.</p></div>
<div class='panel'><h2>Reptilians Found Infested With Ancient AI</h2><p><b>Phrase meaning:</b> In the map, "Reptilians Found Infested With Ancient AI" functions as a named claim-node rather than a neutral label; it asserts a specific reality-frame that the reader is asked to treat as interconnected with surrounding nodes. <b>Local context:</b> The label appears in a region where spiritual, geopolitical, technical, and disclosure motifs overlap, so it is meant to be read relationally, not in isolation. <b>Narrative role:</b> This node acts as one of five roles in the map grammar - authority anchor, threat anchor, mechanism anchor, actor anchor, or resolution anchor - and helps advance the transition from hidden-control storyline to awakening/disclosure storyline. <b>Adjacency:</b> Terms around "Reptilians Found Infested With Ancient AI" typically connect upward to cosmology/source language, laterally to covert-program or ET-faction language, and downward to timeline/disclosure outcomes, creating the map's signature claim-network cascade.</p></div>
