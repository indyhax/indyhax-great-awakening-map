<div class='panel'><h3 id='mass-meditation'>Mass Meditation</h3><p><b>Exact phrase:</b> <span class='kbd'>Mass Meditation</span>. <b>Local context on map:</b> In collective-action consciousness areas. At map scale, this phrase sits inside a crowded semantic neighborhood where arrows, proximity, and visual grouping all imply hierarchy and causality, so its meaning is not isolated text but a position-dependent cue. <b>Narrative role:</b> Provides low-barrier participatory ritual that allegedly affects planetary timelines. In the dossier reading model, it helps convert abstract worldview claims into a staged story with actors, mechanisms, and expected outcomes; this is why the same term often appears to carry emotional load (fear, hope, urgency) at once. <b>Relation to adjacent terms:</b> Adjacent to collective consciousness, Schumann coherence, and awakening signals.
